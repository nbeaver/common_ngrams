I want to do some text mining on scientific papers
to get better search engine results.

In particular, I have a corpus of four or five related papers
each between three and six thousand words
(the "good" papers that I want to show up in search results)
and another corpus of papers from the same field
which have shown up in search engine results
but don't do the characterization methods I'm interested in
(the "false positives").
